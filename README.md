# RC4_RSA_Encryption
Using Python to demo WEP and RSA to encrypt and decrypt plaintext

# Explain plaintext, encrypt and decrypt files
- plaintext file uses for input
- encrypt file uses for storing result after run RSA.py or WEP.py and choose encrypt
- decrypt file uses for storing result after run RSA.py or WEP.py and choose decrypt
